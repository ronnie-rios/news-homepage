## My process

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

- This was great practice building a CSS grid layout using Tailwind in a React Application.
- Utilizing the `config` file in Tailwind to set the fonts and colors.

### Continued development

Some of the sections on the `HomePage` can easily be more modular and divided into their own components.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Easy to use and find what you need. Also provides great examples.
